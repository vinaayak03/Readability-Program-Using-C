This program calculates the approximate grade level required to understand a given text using the Coleman-Liau index. 

The Coleman-Liau index of a text is designed to output that (U.S.) grade level that is needed to understand some text. The formula is

index = 0.0588 * L - 0.296 * S - 15.8


It analyzes the input text for letters, words, and sentences, then computes a grade level based on the formula. The output indicates the appropriate grade level or suggests that the text is suitable for before Grade 1. Use a standard C compiler to run the program.
